The cloud is everywhere. From the relentless growth of Google, Amazon, and Microsoft came a new paradigm of computing efficiency: scale. But who controls your data?

At Boniface Labs, we seek to build the datacenter of tomorrow, on-premises, with your data under your control. Leveraging open-source technologies, we've built a full stack to deliver your applications, the way you want them, following best practices. With Boniface Labs, the cloud just got a little less intimidating.
